Instituto de Estadísticas de Puerto Rico - Challenge #2: 

- Create a personalized Cost Of Living Index calculator
The Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics gathers data that allows the San Juan Metro Area
to participate in the Cost-of-Living Index (COLI) of the Council for Community and
Economic Research (C2ER). COLI is prepared using prices from a selected group of
57 specific products. The results are shared with users through a “COLI calculator”; see
for example here. These products were chosen many years ago to be representative of
the consumption of middle-to-upper class professional households. However, not every
individual will choose to buy all 57 specific products. Therefore, there is an interest to
be able to allow the data user to select which categories are of interest to their particular
circumstances. In this challenge, teams will develop a COLI calculator that allows
individuals to select which of the 57 categories are relevant to their circumstances, the
app will calculate the resulting COLI index and allow the user to determine their
comparable salary in one of the other almost 300 regions where COLI is calculated.
